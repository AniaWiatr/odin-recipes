        <h1>Breakfast Pita</h1>
        <img src="/odin-recipes/img/pita.jpeg" alt="Eggs and potatoes in pita">
        <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>This is my favorite breakfast recipe next day after dinner party.</p>
       <p>Usually, we would have plenty baked potatoes leftover, and they make a fabulous marriage with scrambled eggs.</p>
       <p>If you also have some pita bread in the house, that would make a perfect "pocket" to load potatoes and eggs in! Otherwise, good whole wheat bread will be fine as well.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>1 pita bread, cut in half</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooked and diced potatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Steps:</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pita bread in oven to warm</li>
        <li>Heat a medium skillet over high heat. Coat with cooking spray. Add potatoes and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add eggs. Mix gently until eggs are firm, about 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper. Remove pita from oven. Stuff pita with potato and egg mixture. Eat immediately.</li>
        
       </ol>

       <p><strong>ENJOY!</strong></p>
