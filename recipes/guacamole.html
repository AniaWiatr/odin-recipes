        <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>This is my favorite guacamole recipe that my wife, Emily taught me many years ago.</p>
       <p>During the times, when we lived in the UK, it was the very first time when I was introduced to Mexican food.</p>
       <p>Emily taught me this recipe, and since then I was hooked!</p>
